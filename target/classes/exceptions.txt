The different exceptions:
    Because I have different text field objects in my project,
    they all can generate exceptions.
    Since there are a variety of different foods, I figured that creating 
    an exception for an invalid food name would not make much sense. However,
    I created methods that would generate exceptions for invalid food flavors,
    textures, and types. 

    For the invalid type exception, it would be shown on the pane
    that the user input is invalid if the user enters something other than,
    "fruit," "vegetable," "grain," or "meat."

    For the invalid flavor exception, it would be shown on the pane
    that the user input is invalid if the user enters something other than,
    "sweet," "bitter," "sour," or "salty."

    For the invalid texture exception, it would be shown on the pane
    that the user input is invalid if the user enters something other than,
    "soft," "crunchy," "chewy," or "smooth."
